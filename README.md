# Recreational-Club-Membership

This was a group assignment for my Introduction To Software Engineering class.

In this project, my groupmates and I developed a website for a hypothetical reacreational club which members, coaches and treasurers could access.

We created login functionality to allow for different access to different tools depending on the role of the person logging in.

The members had access to the member page, in which they could schedule when they would go to meet ups, and pay for entry ahead of time.

The coaches had access to the coach page, which allowed them to schedule meet ups and send notes to members.

The treasurers had access to the treasurer page, in which they could keep track of the clubs finances, and make sure that all members are paying for their attendances properly.
